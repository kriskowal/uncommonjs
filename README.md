UncommonJS
==========

Decentralized JavaScript conventions and API design.  An
opinionated fork of CommonJS.  Fork me to show support, fix,
and extend.

============

Specifications are developed in separate directories and
epynomous branches.  These are merged one-way into a master
branch to provide the whole picture.  I encourage
participants to create their own master branch that only
merges the specifications that they are tracking and
approve.
